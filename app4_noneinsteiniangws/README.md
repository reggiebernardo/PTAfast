Python notebook, codes, and chains for studying Hellings-Downs alternative correlation hypothesis to pulsar timing array observations by NANOGrav and Chinese PTA as discussed in ([2310.07537](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07537)).

#### Main notebook/codes: results
`JointAnalysis.ipynb` - Joint analysis of the correlations with NANOGrav and CPTA data <br />
`___.py` - correlation model likelihoods in angular space given the NANOGrav/CPTA correlations data <br />
`___.yaml` - cobaya-polychord configuration files <br />

Notes: Chains saved in `polyc` directory. Install PTAfast as `pip install PTAfast`.
